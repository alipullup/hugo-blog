- I didn't know there was a [Research Wahlberg meme](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EEoO0EMXsAAYFbo.jpg),
  see [this twitter account](https://twitter.com/researchmark). 
- Interesting article about [Haskell naming conventions](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/naming-conventions)
- [Interesting Linux kernel issue](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209725) 
  where L1 [ASPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_State_Power_Management) was calculated incorrectly 
  thus leading to slow network performance.
