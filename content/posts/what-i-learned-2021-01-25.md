- Stanford has a website called [Data Visualization and the Modern Imagination](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/dataviz/).
  The website has many interesting examples of charts, maps, and graphs.
- Likewise, [National Atlas of Japan](https://www.gsi.go.jp/atlas/atlas-e-etsuran.html) is beautiful.
  Some notes I took:
  - [Pie-charts overlay on maps](https://www.gsi.go.jp/atlas/archive/j-atlas-d_2e_30.pdf): area used to compare different regions, chart itself informs about the region. 
  - Same color is used across different charts (e.g. "red" always denotes foodstuffs)
  - [Out ring in pie-charts](https://www.gsi.go.jp/atlas/archive/j-atlas-d_2e_31.pdf) is used to indicate grouping
  - [Railway traffic](https://www.gsi.go.jp/atlas/archive/j-atlas-d_e_49.pdf) volume is shown by thicker lines, passenger volume at station is shown by circular area (logarithmic)
- "Edge" vs. "Trunk" has different meaning based on vendor - sometimes surprisingly different!
- IEC 61850 has a [technical issue database](https://iec61850.tissue-db.com/parts.mspx)
- Linux kernel folk have a nice page on [page replacement policies](https://linux-mm.org/AdvancedPageReplacement).
  The "best" page replacement policy seems to be workload dependent: ARC, CAR, LIRS, CLOCK-Pro, ...
  Linux kernel [list of problem workloads](https://linux-mm.org/ProblemWorkloads). 
- To learn about Linux LVM: [introductory article](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/lvm-demystified),
  [LVM Administrator Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html-single/logical_volume_manager_administration/index) by RedHat.
- [Arxiv Sanity Preserver](http://arxiv-sanity.com/top?timefilter=alltime&vfilter=all) - find "top" papers
