I started the online course [Improving your statistical inferences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences) 
by [Daniel Lakens](http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/). It's been a great refresher. I am considering publishing my notes online.

The course starts by looking at *p* values. If nothing else, everyone should go through the first week of the course.

|                         | H0 True                 | H1 True                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Significant finding     | False positive (α)      | True positive (1-α)    |
| Non-significant finding | True negative (1-β)     | False negative (β)     |
