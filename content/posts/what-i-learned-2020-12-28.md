- [P99](https://gitlab.inria.fr/gustedt/p99/) is a set of macro and function definitions
  to ease programming "modern C" (C99). 
  [P99 API documentation](https://p99.gforge.inria.fr/p99-html/index.html).
  Well documented, but rather large. Doesn't seem to be actively updated (perhaps there is no need?)
- If `-ffreestanding` is given to GCC, then `__STDC_HOSTED__` will be set to `0`
- The book [Computer Age Statistical Inference](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/) by Efron and Hastie
  seems well written. Browsed through the first few chapters and was impressed.
  Some [exercises available here](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI_files/PDF/CASI_Exercises.pdf).
- I didn't know that [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/)
  by Christopher Bishop is available for free as a PDF!
